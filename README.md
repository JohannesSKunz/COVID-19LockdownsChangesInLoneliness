## Overview 

This repository contains replication files and data for [Kung, Kunz, and Shields (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953623000473); more details can be found in the paper. 

The analysis is based on external restricted datasets that we do not re-post here since they are held by different entities. 

Here we describe how to access them and provide our codes. We are encouraging any replication attempt and interested readers shall not hesitate to contact [Claryn Kung](mailto:claryn.kung@ucl.ac.uk) about any of these. For brevity, we also exclude the multitude of replication files for the Appendix version but are happy to provide these upon request. 

## Replication do-files 

Here we collect all do-files and data used in our analysis. We do not repost the full dataset as these were too large for the Github repository, please contact us if you have issues replicating it. 

*These will be added shortly.*

## Data access
