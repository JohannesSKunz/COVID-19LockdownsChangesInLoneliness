## Overview 

This repository contains replication files and data for [Kung, Kunz, and Shields (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953623000473); more details can be found in the paper. 

The analysis is based on external restricted datasets that we do not re-post here since they are held by different entities. 

Here we describe how to access them and provide our codes. We are encouraging any replication attempt and interested readers shall not hesitate to contact [Claryn Kung](mailto:claryn.kung@ucl.ac.uk) about any of these. For brevity, we also exclude the multitude of replication files for the Appendix version but are happy to provide these upon request. 

## Replication do-files 

Here we collect the do-file used in our analysis. We do not repost the dataset as it is proprietary, which approved access and the dofile all main results should be replicable. Please let us know if you encounter any issues. 

## Data access

Data access will have to be applied for separately from [Understanding Society](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/access-data), the [COVID supplement](https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8644-11) and the [mainstage survey](ttps://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-6614-18) are necessary for replication h.
